Can’t stop, won’t stop with the soup recipes this winter. ♡

And today’s recipe is one that I’ve been meaning to share with you on the blog for years, after literally dozens and dozens of you have requested it.  (This usually comes up when I’m chatting about my favorite egg drop soup recipe — apparently many of you usually opt for the hot and sour soup at your favorite Chinese restaurants and have wanted to learn how to make it!)

Well, good news, friends!  Traditional hot and sour soup is actually incredibly easy to make as well.  And the bonus of making it at home is that it’s also incredibly easy to customize to your taste.  Like it extra hot?  Add in more chili garlic sauce.  Like it extra sour?  Add in more rice wine vinegar.  Like it vegetarian?  Make it with tofu.  Like the meat version?  Just add in some pork.

Trust me, this is one of those restaurant recipes that will taste just as good at home.  And on chilly winter weeks like this one that we’re having here in Kansas City, it’s guaranteed to warm you up in the most delicious of ways.
